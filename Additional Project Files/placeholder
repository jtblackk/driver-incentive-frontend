There's a lot of files in here! Here's some descriptions of them
----------------------------------------------------------------


Lambda Functions.zip - all of the lambda functions used by the web application, exported.

Lambda layers - these are extensions to lambda fucntions that some of our functions require. For instance, GetEbayItemsByID requires the "requests" library, and must use a layer to use it.

api tutorial - tutorial for how to set up each of the apis our application relies on

frontend-api gateway-lambda key.txt
A file that enumerates all of the lambda functions used by the frontend and associates each with an api gateway endpoint. This is just a clone of a file that the frontend uses for manageing apis.

1. clone the repo (if you haven't already)

2. open the repo in your code editor/terminal

3. create a new branch in azure

4. call git fetch in your local repo

5. switch to the new branch in your local repo

6. download node.js/npm if you haven't already

7. run 'npm install' in your local repo to download most of the packages you need

8. download the aws cli if you haven't already (you will only have to do this once)
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html

9. configure the aws cli
	* (only once) run 'aws configure' and put random junk data into the first two fields (this will get replaced) and correct data into the region and output fields (us-east-1, json) (this will create a .aws folder in %USERPROFILE%/)
	* (every time you start a new coding session) paste your awseducate credentials into %USERPROFILE%/.aws/credentials
 
10. run 'npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli' to download the amplify CLI (you will only have to do this once, thanks to -g)

11. run 'amplify env add'

	* select 'default' when prompted 'please choose the profile you want to use'
	* let it do its thing

12. run 'amplify pull' to update your local amplify environment

13. run 'npm start' and have fun coding!

14. push commits to your azure branch by using 'git push'
	* for now, just commit all of the file that get created in the process of using amplify.

15. when finished with a set of user stories, create a pull request and we'll push the changes to the live repo on github
